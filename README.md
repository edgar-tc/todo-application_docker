Sample Node.js Application.

This repository contains a sample Node.js to-do application, containerized using Docker.

Key Steps:

Dockerfile Creation: Created a Dockerfile to define the environment and dependencies for the Node.js application.
Image Building: Used the Dockerfile to build a Docker image for the application.
Container Creation: Deployed containers from the built Docker image.
Pushing to Docker Hub: Pushed the Docker image to Docker Hub for easy distribution and access.
Pulling the Image: To deploy the application in the future, simply use the docker pull command to retrieve the image from Docker Hub.
This setup allows for consistent and repeatable deployments of the Node.js to-do application across different environments.
